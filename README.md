# React-Employee-Directory [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

As a full-stack developer, we want to be able to create an application directory for employees using React, its library, and a random user api in order to build an interactive user interface. A given user can search for the employee(s) by typing it into the search bar which should populate the results if any. This React UI also can be seen populating the first name, last name, and location in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column header names to perhaps simplify your search for that employee. With the show entries feature, a user is also able to populate as little or as many employees to the page as they would like.   

## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```
